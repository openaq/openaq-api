### Overview

Welcome to the OpenAQ API! This API is used to power various [tools built by the community](https://openaq.org/#/community) as well as [openaq.org](https://openaq.org). 

If you have any problems, please create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/openaq/openaq-api/issues)!

### API vs S3 Data Retention

Currently the API supports a 2 year archive of the data. For access to the full dataset, you can access S3 directly by going [here](https://openaq-fetches.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) or [here](https://openaq-data.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). Read [this explainer](https://medium.com/@openaq/how-in-the-world-do-you-access-air-quality-data-older-than-90-days-on-the-openaq-platform-8562df519ecd) on how to use AWS Athena for historical data access.

### Rate Limiting
