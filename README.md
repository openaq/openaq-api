# OpenAQ Platform API 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openaq/openaq-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openaq/openaq-api)

## Overview
This is the main API for the [OpenAQ](https://openaq.org) project.

Starting with `index.js`, there is a web-accessible API that provides endpoints to query the air quality measurements. Documentation can be found at [https://docs.openaq.org/](https://docs.openaq.org/).

[openaq-fetch](https://github.com/openaq/openaq-fetch) takes care of fetching new data and inserting into the database. Data format is explained in [openaq-data-format](https://github.com/openaq/openaq-data-format).

## Installing & Running
To run the API locally, you will need both [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) installed.

Install necessary Node.js packages by running

`npm install`

Make sure you have a PostgreSQL database available (with PostGIS extension) and have the DB settings in `knexfile.js`.

Now you can get started with:

`npm start`

For production deployment, you will need to have certain environment variables set as in the table below (for production deployments, these are stored in an S3 bucket).

| Name | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| API_URL | Base API URL after deployment | http://<hostname>:3004 | 
| NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY | New Relic API key for system monitoring | not set |
| WEBHOOK_KEY | Secret key to interact with openaq-api | '123' |
| USE_REDIS | Use Redis for caching? | not set (so not used) |
| REDIS_URL | Redis instance URL | redis://localhost:6379 |
| KEEN_PROJECT_ID | Keen project ID for analytics. | not set |
| KEEN_WRITE_KEY | Keen write key for analytics. | not set |

## Tests
To confirm that everything is working as expected, you can run the tests with

`npm test`

## Dockerfile
There is a Dockerfile included that will turn the project into a Docker container. The container can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/flasher/openaq-api/) and is currently mostly used for deployment purposes for [AWS ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/). If someone wanted to make it better for local development, that'd be a great PR!
