# OpenAQ Platform API
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openaq/openaq-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openaq/openaq-api)
[![Slack Chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/Chat-Slack-ff69b4.svg "Join us. Anyone is welcome!")](https://openaq-slackin.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview
This is the main API for the [OpenAQ](https://openaq.org) project.

Starting with `index.js`, there is a web-accessible API that provides endpoints to query the air quality measurements. Documentation can be found at [https://docs.openaq.org/](https://docs.openaq.org/).

[openaq-fetch](https://github.com/openaq/openaq-fetch) takes care of fetching new data and inserting into the database. Data format is explained in [openaq-data-format](https://github.com/openaq/openaq-data-format).

## Getting started

Install prerequisites:

- [git](https://git-scm.com)
- [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Clone this repository locally (see these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)) and activate the required Node.js version with:

`nvm install`

The last step can be skipped if the local Node.js version matches the one defined at [.nvmrc](.nvmrc). 

Install module dependencies:

`npm install`

### Development

Initialize development database:

`npm run init-dev-db`

This task will start a PostgreSQL container as daemon, run migrations and seed data. Each of these tasks is available to be run independently, please refer to [package.json](package.json) to learn the options.

After initialization is finished, start the development server:

`npm run dev`

Access http://localhost:3004.

Stop database container after finishing:

`npm run stop-dev-db`

### Testing 

Initialize test database:

`npm run init-test-db`

This task will start a PostgreSQL container as daemon, run migrations and seed data. After initialization is finished, run tests:

`npm run test`

Stop database container after finishing:

`npm run stop-test-db`

## Deploying to production

The server needs to fetch data about locations and cities in the measurement history using AWS Athena. This service must be configured via the following environment variables:

- `ATHENA_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: an AWS Access Key that has permissions to create Athena Queries and store them in S3;
- `ATHENA_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: the corresponding secret;
- `ATHENA_OUTPUT_BUCKET`: S3 location (in the form of `s3://bucket/folder`) where the results of the Athena queries should be stored before caching them;
- `ATHENA_FETCHES_TABLE`: the name of the table registered in AWS Athena.

Automatic Athena synchronization is disabled by default. It can be enabled by setting the environment variable `ATHENA_SYNC_ENABLED` to `true`. The sync interval can be set using `ATHENA_SYNC_INTERVAL` variable, in miliseconds. The default interval is set in file [config/default.json](config/default.json).

If needed, the synchronization can be fired manually. First, the `WEBHOOK_KEY` variable must be set to allow access webhooks endpoint. Sending a POST request to /v1/webhooks, including the parameters `key=<WEBHOOK_KEY>` and `action=ATHENA_SYNC`, will start a sync run. An example with curl:

```
curl --data "key=123&action=ATHENA_SYNC" https://localhost:3004/v1/webhooks
```

Other environment variables available:

| Name | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| API_URL | Base API URL after deployment | http://<hostname>:3004 |
| NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY | New Relic API key for system monitoring | not set |
| WEBHOOK_KEY | Secret key to interact with openaq-api | '123' |
| USE_REDIS | Use Redis for caching? | not set (so not used) |
| USE_ATHENA | Use AWS Athena for aggregations? | not set (so not used) |
| REDIS_URL | Redis instance URL | redis://localhost:6379 |
| DO_NOT_UPDATE_CACHE | Ignore updating cache, but still use older cached results. | not set |
| AGGREGATION_REFRESH_PERIOD | How long to wait before refreshing cached aggregations? (in ms) | 45 minutes |
| REQUEST_LIMIT | Max number of items that can be requested at one time. | 10000 |
| UPLOADS_ENCRYPTION_KEY | Key used to encrypt upload token for /upload in database. | 'not_secure' |
| S3_UPLOAD_BUCKET | The bucket to upload external files to for /upload. | not set |

### AWS Athena for aggregations


The Athena table is `fetches_realtime` that represents the fetches from `openaq-data` and has the following schema:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE fetches.fetches_realtime (
  date struct<utc:string,local:string>,
  parameter string,
  location string,
  value float,
  unit string,
  city string,
  attribution array<struct<name:string,url:string>>,
  averagingPeriod struct<unit:string,value:float>,
  coordinates struct<latitude:float,longitude:float>,
  country string,
  sourceName string,
  sourceType string,
  mobile string
 )
 ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
 LOCATION 's3://EXAMPLE_BUCKET'
```

## Uploads & Generating S3 presigned URLs

Via an undocumented `/upload` endpoint, there is the ability to generate presigned S3 PUT URLs so that external clients can authenticate using tokens stored in the database and upload data to be ingested by `openaq-fetch`. There is a small utility file called `encrypt.js` that you can use like `UPLOADS_ENCRYPTION_KEY=foo node index.js your_token_here` to generate encrypted tokens to be manually stored in database.

## Dockerfile

There is a Dockerfile included that will turn the project into a Docker container. The container can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/flasher/openaq-api/) and is currently mostly used for deployment purposes for [AWS ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/). If someone wanted to make it better for local development, that'd be a great PR!
